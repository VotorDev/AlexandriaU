# Happy Birthday Hiro!

As the head of the history department, I am thrilled to announce the birthday celebration of our beloved department pet, Hiro, a Wad space creature. Hiro has been a fixture in our department for several years now, and his presence has brought a unique and fascinating perspective to our studies of history.

The Wad species, as many of you may know, are an incredibly intelligent and inquisitive species that have made significant contributions to the scientific community. Hiro, in particular, has been a valuable member of our department, providing insights into historical events that we would have otherwise never been able to obtain.

Hiro's birthday is a cause for celebration, not only because it is an opportunity to show our appreciation for his contributions to our department, but also because it is a chance to reflect on the importance of embracing diversity and learning from those who come from different backgrounds and perspectives.

As we gather to celebrate Hiro's birthday, let us take a moment to appreciate the incredible value that diversity brings to our department and to our understanding of history. Here's to many more years of learning and discovery with our beloved department pet, Hiro!
