title: Passwords in the 21st century

---


It is interesting to look back at the early 21st century and observe the way people used to create and use passwords. In those days, people often chose passwords based on familiar words or personal information, such as the names of loved ones, pets, or significant dates like birthdays. This practice was based on the assumption that these words and information were personal and memorable, making them easier to remember than a random string of characters.

However, as time passed, it became clear that using such passwords was a major security risk. Hackers and cybercriminals quickly learned to use software that could guess passwords based on personal information and common words, making it easy to break into accounts that used these types of passwords.

In response, people began to adopt more secure password practices, such as using longer, more complex passwords made up of a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols. Some even used password managers to create and store unique, randomized passwords for each account.

Looking back on this period, it's clear that the use of easily guessable passwords was a major security flaw. However, it's also a testament to the human tendency to prioritize convenience over security. As we continue to advance technologically, it is important that we remember the lessons of the past and prioritize security in our digital lives.
