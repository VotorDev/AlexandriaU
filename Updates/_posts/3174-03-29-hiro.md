# Hiro

Hiro never ceases to surprise me. He seems to know so much about the history of the universe. He remembers everything about his home planet Warth and his Wad species, however he still can't remember how he arrived to this planet. He seems to have lived a lot too, still he looks so young and agile. I asked him when he was born and he said his date of birth is X6-523-0087 but that doesn't match any date system known, it's fascinating.
I can't believe it's going to be a year next month since we found him on the fields, lost and beaten... We should take that date as Hiro's birthday and have a Department party, everybody loves Hiro and should raise the spirits, considering...
